    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Brussels sprouts with bacon are roasted in a mixture of maple syrup and olive oil, resulting in a crispy, caramelized side dish that's quick and easy to make and perfect for weeknight dinners.</p>
    <p>The Brussels sprouts take on a nutty flavor during the roasting process, and the salty bacon is a delightful contrast with the sweet maple syrup â€” who knew Brussels sprouts with bacon could ever taste this good?</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound whole Brussels sprouts</li>
        <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li> half a teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>quarter teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </li>
        <li>quarter cup extra-virgin olive oil </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons pure maple syrup</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. </li>
        <li>Trim ends off Brussels sprouts and cut any large ones in half. Transfer to a large bowl. </li>
        <li>Add bacon, salt, and pepper to the Brussels spouts. Drizzle olive oil and maple syrup over top and toss until sprouts are well coated.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and spread in a single layer.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until bacon is crispy and Brussels sprouts are caramelized, 20 to 30 minutes, stirring halfway through. </li>
    </ol>
